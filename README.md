Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing

Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations like passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.




The objective of this project is to reduce the time that Mercedes-Benz cars spend on the test bench. The dataset mainly describes various factors responsible for the time taken by Mercedes-Benz cars to pass the testing. Optimizing the algorithm will be our primary focus since it is directly proportional to faster testing. The columns with zero variance have been removed from the dataset. Dimensionality reduction is performed using principal component analysis technique to reduce the excess computational time and to reduce redundant features if any. Hyperparameter tuning is performed with the help of GridSearchCV for the XGBoost algorithm parameters and the test values are predicted using the same.
